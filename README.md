# Pivotal Agency Code Style Guides

The following style guide were developed and are maintained by Pivotal Agency. They are used by our team of developers.

Each directory in this repo may contain a README.md file with the style guide as well as appropriate linting configuration.

We've developed the following code style guides, to:

- Improve team-wide code quality
- Enhance each product's performance
- Reduce developer decision making fatigue
- In general, code consistency and readability across team members
- Help on-board new team members

## Style Guides

 - Use 4 spaces for PHP
- Install [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to your editor, to recognize our .editorconfig file per project

## Amendments

We encourage you to fork this guide and change the rules to fit your team's style guide. Below, you may list some amendments to the style guide. This allows you to periodically update your style guide without having to deal with merge conflicts.
