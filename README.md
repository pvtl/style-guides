We've developed the following code style guides, to:

- Improve team-wide code quality
- Enhance each product's performance
- Reduce developer decision making fatigue
- In general, code consistency and readability across team members
- Help on-board new team members

## Team-wide Editor Settings

 - Ensure the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) exists in the root dir of your project
- Indentations - spaces not tabs
 - Use 2 spaces for all files except:
 - Use 4 spaces for PHP

## Amendments

We encourage you to fork this guide and change the rules to fit your team's style guide. Below, you may list some amendments to the style guide. This allows you to periodically update your style guide without having to deal with merge conflicts.
